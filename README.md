# Vagrant nginx

No nonsense. Default web root in `nginx/html/default/`. Virtual host
configurations in `sites-enabled/`. That's it.

# Usage

Install [Vagrant]. Run `vagrant up`. That's it.

# Other Details

* Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty x64
* nginx 1.4.6 (or whatever is currently in the default Trusty repo)
